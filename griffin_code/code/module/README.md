## Python Module Help

To structure your Python project so that the project folders can access classes and methods in the module folder, you'll want to ensure that Python recognizes your `module_folder` as a package and that it's accessible from your project folders. Here's a simple way to set this up:

### Step 1: Make `module_folder` a Python Package

In your `module_folder`, create an empty file named `__init__.py`. This file doesn't need to contain any code; its presence alone marks the directory as a Python package, allowing its contents to be imported elsewhere.

Your directory structure should now look like this:

```
code_folder/
|-- module_folder/
|   |-- __init__.py  # This makes 'module_folder' a Python package
|   |-- helper.py    # Example module with helper classes/functions
|
|-- project_1_folder/
|   |-- script1.py   # Example script in Project 1
|
|-- project_2_folder/
    |-- script2.py   # Example script in Project 2
```

### Step 2: Importing from `module_folder` in Your Project Folders

To import classes or functions from `module_folder` into your projects, you'll need to ensure that Python can find `module_folder`. The simplest way to do this, without modifying system paths or environment variables, is to run your scripts from the `code_folder` directory and use relative imports.

For example, if `helper.py` in `module_folder` contains a class named `HelperClass`, you can import it in `script1.py` in `project_1_folder` like so:

```python
# project_1_folder/script1.py
from module_folder.helper import HelperClass

# Now you can use HelperClass in script1.py
helper_instance = HelperClass()
```

### Step 3: Running Your Scripts

When running your scripts, make sure your current working directory is `code_folder`, so Python can correctly resolve the relative imports. For example, to run `script1.py`, navigate to `code_folder` in your terminal and use:

```sh
python -m project_1_folder.script1
```

Using the `-m` flag with Python runs the module as a script, allowing for relative imports based on your current working directory.

### Simplifying Imports for Deeply Nested Projects

If your projects become more complex and deeply nested, managing imports might get cumbersome. In such cases, you might consider adding `code_folder` to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, which tells Python to include it in the module search path. This way, you can import from `module_folder` more directly, without worrying about your current working directory.

However, for simple projects and the structure you've described, the above steps should suffice and keep your imports clean and straightforward.
