To identify each face within an augmented image, you can use a face detection library or model that is robust enough to handle the variations introduced by augmentation. One popular and effective choice is the OpenCV library, which includes pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers for face detection, as well as DNN-based models that can be more accurate and robust against image transformations.

Here's a simplified example using OpenCV's deep neural network (DNN) module with a pre-trained model for face detection:

```python
import cv2

# Load the pre-trained model for face detection
face_net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromCaffe('deploy.prototxt', 'res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel')

# Load the augmented image
image = cv2.imread('augmented_image_0.jpg')  # Example for the first augmented image

# Prepare the image for the model
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(cv2.resize(image, (300, 300)), 1.0, (300, 300), (104.0, 177.0, 123.0))

# Perform face detection
face_net.setInput(blob)
detections = face_net.forward()

# Draw bounding boxes around detected faces
for i in range(detections.shape[2]):
    confidence = detections[0, 0, i, 2]
    if confidence > 0.5:  # Consider detection as a face if confidence > 0.5
        box = detections[0, 0, i, 3:7] * np.array([image.shape[1], image.shape[0], image.shape[1], image.shape[0]])
        (startX, startY, endX, endY) = box.astype("int")
        cv2.rectangle(image, (startX, startY), (endX, endY), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Display the image with detected faces
cv2.imshow("Detected Faces", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This example uses OpenCV's DNN module with a pre-trained Caffe model for face detection (`deploy.prototxt` and `res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel`), which you'll need to download. The code reads an augmented image, prepares it for the model, performs face detection, and draws bounding boxes around detected faces. The result is displayed in a window.

This approach can be applied to each augmented image to identify faces within them. The DNN-based model is generally more robust to variations in face orientation, lighting, and other factors that might be introduced by augmentation compared to simpler models like Haar Cascades.
